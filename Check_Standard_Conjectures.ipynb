    "**Summary**: This code checks whether the arithmetic Chow rings $\\widehat{\\mathrm{CH}}^\\ast(G(m,n))$ of the Grassmannian $G(m,n)$ defined over $\\mathbb{Z}$ satisfy the arithmetic standard conjectures of Gillet and Soulé. To do so, we use an explicit additive basis for the Chow ring $R_{m,n} = \\mathrm{CH}(\\overline{G(m,n)})$ of the canonical Arakelov variety $\\overline{G(m,n)}$ associated to $G(m,n)$, which corresponds to the presentation appearing in the article \"*Explicit Arakelov-Chow rings of Grassmannians, and arithmetic standard conjectures on  projective space*\"."
